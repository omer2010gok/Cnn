      <p>Uptown, NYC — A man wearing a bucket hat caused a stir Monday afternoon after accidentally dropping his AirPods into a swirl of pistachio gelato at one of the city's most upscale ice cream shops.</p>
      <p>The incident took place at *Crème de Luxe*, an establishment known for its $18 cones and Instagram-worthy decor. According to eyewitnesses, the man, casually dressed but sporting a stylish bucket hat, fumbled his AirPods while ordering a double scoop and watched helplessly as they plunged into the creamy abyss.</p>
      <p>"Everyone in the shop just kind of froze," said one customer. "You could hear the splash. It was dramatic."
      </p>
      <p>The store went quiet as staff and patrons looked on in disbelief. One employee offered him a spoon, but the man reportedly just laughed, scooped the AirPods out, wiped them on his shirt, and said, "Guess they needed a chill."
      </p>
      <p>No damage was reported, though it remains unclear whether the AirPods survived the dip. The man left shortly afterward, still enjoying his ice cream and nodding to the beat of something only he could hear.</p>
